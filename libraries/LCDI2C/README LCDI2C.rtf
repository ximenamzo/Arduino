\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is a library I put together to use the web4robot.com lcd display in I2C mode.\
\
I have no financial interest in web4robot.com, I purchased one of their displays on e-bay to experiment with.\
\
I used the code I found e for the arduino-4bitlcd libary from http://code.google.com/p/arduino-4bitlcd/  as a place to start\
\
It uses the standard Arduino I2c Wires interface and the following pins\
\
Uses Analog pin 4 - SDA\
Uses Analog pin 5 - SCL\
\
The LCD and keypad are supported. The interrupt pin for the keypad is not supported by this version of the library.\
\
Graphing functions contributed to the library by Ran Talbott\
\
\
---------\
\
\
Init with \
\
LCDI2C lcd = LCDI2C(2,16,0x4C,0);             // Where number of lines = 2, Columns = 16 and 0x4C is the i2c address of the display, type of display(Future Use)\
\
\
The following commands are available for within the library.\
\
\
init()					Init the LCD and library functions, Clears the display, turns off the cursors\
\
command(command)		Write a command not supported yet in the library to the display\
\
position(Row, Column)		Move the cursor to position valid range is Row[0-3], Column[0,19]\
\
setCursor(Row,Column)		Same as position\
\
print(val)				Uses the inherited print command so you can do things like lcd.print(int,DEC);\
\
println(val)				Uses the inherited print command so you can do things like lcd.print(int,DEC);\
\
printstr(string)			Print a string to the display\
\
write(byte)				Raw write a single byte to the display\
\
clear()					Clear the display and place the cursor at 0,0\
  \
home()				Home the cursor to 0,0 but do not clear the display\
  \
on()					Turn the LCD display on\
  \
off()					Turn the LCD display off (not backlight does not go off)\
  \
cursor_on()				Turn the blinking line cursor on\
  \
cursor_off()				Turn the blinking line cursor off\
  \
blink_on()				Turn the blinking block cursor on\
  \
blink_off()				Turn the blinking block cursor on\
  \
left()					Move the cursor to the left\
  \
right()					Move the cursor to the right\
  \
keypad()				read a value from the keypad. Returns 0 if no key press is in the buffer\
\
init_bargraph(mode)		Init graphics functions where mode can be\
						LCDI2C_VERTICAL_BAR_GRAPH\
						LCDI2C_HORIZONTAL_BAR_GRAPH\
						LCDI2C_HORIZONTAL_LINE_GRAPH\
\
draw_horizontal_graph(row,col,len,end)\
\
draw_vertical_graph(row,col,len,end)\
\
load_custom_character(char_num,*char)\
\
set_backlight_brightness(val)\
\
set_contrast(val)\
\
  -------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
\
Version 0.1				3/4/2009 Initial Release\
\
Version 0.2				3/12/2009\
\
					Change the print and println so they use the inherited print library.\
					This allows us to do things like lcd.print(int,DEC);\
\
					Changed the commandWrite(command) to command(command) to bring it more in line with the crystaldisplay library\
\
					Changed the position command to setCursor to bring it more in line with the crystaldisplay library\
\
					Cleaned up the code a bit\
\
Version 0.3				3/16/2009\
				\
					Optimized code\
\
					Created new Samples\
\
Version 0.4				3/27/09\
\
					Added strprint, custom characters, graphing functions, brightness and contrast classes contributed by Ran Talbott\
					Also added some sample sketchs to show off the functions.\
					Fixed name so samples load up correctly\
\
Things to do:\
\
					Add support to new features being added to the web4robot display.\
\
					Add support for the following displays		\
						http://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/htm/Lcd03tech.htm\
						www.newhavendisplay.com\
\
Future\
\
					Possibly Add support for the i2c displays from \
						www.spikenzielabs.com\
						www.hvwtech.com\
						www.robotshop.com\
						www.channaa.com\
\
					(If you are the manufacture of an i2c based LCD character display and would like you display included in the library\
					Please contact me. I will require a sample display and or driver board to keep on hand for testingfrom you.)\
